# cursor-notifier.js
Pops notifications near mouse cursor. So, you will always be notified when something happens on web page.

How to use? Here:
```
var notifier = new CursorNotifier();
//to show
notifier.notify(CursorNotifier.NotificationTypes.Progressing);
//to hide
notifier.hide();
```

an such things. Check the class, it is pretty simple but mastership hides behind this simplicity. Like my old samurai friend said "eat the grape but do never ask the grape garden".
